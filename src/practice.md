  <p class="first-line">I&#8217;m Dr Razvan Beretchi and together with my wife Margareta, we run Abergele Dental Surgery. Originally from Romania, we decided to make the north of Cymru&#8202;/&#8202;Wales our home over 10 years ago and it&#8217;s where we began treating our patients in 2018.</p>

  <p>At home, Margareta and I have two beautiful children&#8212;a girl and boy &#8212; and a cat called Socks. Family life is important to us and we feel that our practice and patients are an extension of our family.</p>
